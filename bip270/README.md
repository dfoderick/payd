# BIP-270

This package is an implementation of the BIP-270 Simplified Payments Protocol.

This protocol defines json objects which are used to implement payments from a user to a merchant in a peer to peer manner.

This package only implements the http handlers and uses the core services defined in the `ppctl` package for the handling of the payments.
